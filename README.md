#Purpose of Github Repository
The purpose of this repository is to let people see the progress that I have made for my website.

#Technologies Used
SvelteKit, Github, UnsplashAPI

#Known Bugs
There is a bug with the API, currently it does not load the images however it does console log them.
Another Issue I have is that when you reload a new page the page will randomly flicker white.

#Future Plans
My future plans for this website is to fix the current known bugs, and to make certain pages look nicer, such as the about page.

# Elements From Websites
This Image shows a hover effect for the text from a nav bar, from the Otago Polytechnic website that I have incorporated into my own website.
